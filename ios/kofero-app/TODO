TODO

- image provision doesnt work on simulator

- images are served incorrectly the first time they load from REST, load correctly when served from disk. almost certainly a view problem, likely being served to the first available grid cell in the uicollectionview, happens in ALL ios views

-write way to display items without having an image on disk, and when that image becomes available on disk then invalidate the grid item and repopulate with new image
	= CREATE CGImage from the item name and pass it into the UIImage?

-write UI to be dark mode friendly
